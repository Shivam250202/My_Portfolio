            <h2>Day 1: Understand Web Design Basics</h2>
            <p>Start by understanding what web design is all about. Familiarize yourself with key terms like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and explore the importance of user experience (UX) and user interface (UI) design.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Read about web design principles.</li>
                <li>Research how websites are built.</li>
                <li>Review a few websites for design inspiration.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Day 2: Learn HTML (Structure of Websites)</h2>
            <p>HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the foundation of every web page. It provides the structure and defines elements like headings, paragraphs, images, and links.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Learn basic HTML tags and structure.</li>
                <li>Practice by creating a simple webpage with text, images, and links.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Day 3: Learn CSS (Styling Websites)</h2>
            <p>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to style your HTML content. With CSS, you can control colors, fonts, layout, and spacing.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Learn basic CSS properties such as color, font-size, padding, margins, and layout.</li>
                <li>Style the webpage you created on Day 2 to make it visually appealing.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Day 4: Dive Into CSS Layout (Flexbox and Grid)</h2>
            <p>Mastering CSS layout is crucial for building responsive and well-structured websites. Focus on Flexbox and CSS Grid, which are modern layout techniques.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Learn how to use Flexbox and Grid to arrange elements on the page.</li>
                <li>Experiment with creating layouts that adjust based on screen size.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Day 5: Responsive Design (Mobile-Friendly Websites)</h2>
            <p>Responsive design ensures your website looks good on all devices—desktops, tablets, and smartphones. Use media queries to adapt your layout for different screen sizes.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Learn about media queries and responsive design principles.</li>
                <li>Test your webpage on different screen sizes, adjusting your layout accordingly.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Day 6: Introduction to JavaScript (Add Interactivity)</h2>
            <p>JavaScript is a powerful language that allows you to add interactivity to your website, like pop-ups, animations, and form validation.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Learn basic JavaScript concepts like variables, functions, and events.</li>
                <li>Add a simple interactive element, such as a button click or a form submission, to your webpage.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Day 7: Web Design Tools and Software</h2>
            <p>Familiarize yourself with design tools like Figma, Adobe XD, or Sketch. These tools allow you to create wireframes and mockups for your website before coding.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Explore the interface of these tools.</li>
                <li>Practice creating a simple wireframe for a website layout.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Day 8: Explore UI/UX Design Principles</h2>
            <p>Good web design is more than just aesthetics. Focus on user experience (UX) and user interface (UI) principles that make websites easy to navigate and engaging for users.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Read about UI/UX best practices.</li>
                <li>Evaluate your webpage for usability and design consistency.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Day 9: Build a Portfolio Website</h2>
            <p>A personal portfolio is essential to showcase your web design skills. Build a simple, professional portfolio that displays your learning progress and practice projects.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Create a portfolio with your bio, the projects you’ve worked on, and a contact form.</li>
                <li>Ensure the design is clean and user-friendly.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Day 10: Final Touches and Review</h2>

            <ul>
                <li>Test for cross-browser compatibility.</li>
                <li>Optimize for performance.</li>
