                    <h2>What is Artificial Intelligence?</h2>
                    <p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the branch of computer science focused on creating systems
                        capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence. These tasks include
                        problem-solving, pattern recognition, decision-making, and language understanding. AI can be
                        categorized into two types:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Narrow AI:</strong> Systems designed to perform a specific task, such as virtual
                            assistants (e.g., Siri or Alexa) and recommendation algorithms (e.g., Netflix
                            recommendations).</li>
                        <li><strong>General AI:</strong> Hypothetical systems with the ability to understand, learn, and
                            apply intelligence across a wide range of tasks, similar to human cognitive abilities. This
                            level of AI is still theoretical and has not been achieved.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>What is Machine Learning?</h2>
                    <p>Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of AI focused on developing algorithms and statistical models
                        that enable computers to learn and make decisions based on data without being explicitly
                        programmed. ML involves:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Supervised Learning:</strong> Training models on labeled data, where the desired
                            output is known. Common algorithms include linear regression, logistic regression, and
                            support vector machines.</li>
                        <li><strong>Unsupervised Learning:</strong> Training models on unlabeled data to discover hidden
                            patterns or intrinsic structures. Examples include clustering algorithms like K-means and
                            dimensionality reduction techniques like Principal Component Analysis (PCA).</li>
                        <li><strong>Reinforcement Learning:</strong> Training models through a system of rewards and
                            penalties based on actions taken within an environment. This approach is often used in
                            robotics and game playing.</li>
                    </ul>
