            <p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
            <p>In today's digital age, having a website is essential, whether you’re a business owner, a freelancer, or
                simply someone with a passion you want to share with the world. Creating a website may seem daunting at
                first, but with the right guidance, it’s a task anyone can accomplish. In this blog, I’ll walk you
                through the steps to create your own website from scratch, regardless of your technical expertise.</p>

            <h2>1. Define Your Purpose and Goals</h2>
            <p>Before you start building your website, it’s crucial to define its purpose. Are you creating a portfolio
                to showcase your work? A blog to share your thoughts? An online store? Understanding your goals will
                guide the design and functionality of your website.</p>
